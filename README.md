# YAY
Yay is Proof of concept of a social platform that revolves around music. I am a big fan of music, Spotify is probably the app that I use the most. I realized that there's very little to no social interaction between the Spotify users. Yay uses the Spotify SDK and the Twitter API to create a social music app, through the app users can control their playback, they have access to a content feed that is made of tweets from the artists and other users that they follow and users can also create groups chat where they can discuss music and synchronize their playbacks.# YAY
